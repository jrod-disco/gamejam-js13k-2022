# Dev Diary

## Day 1
Thought about the concept and came up with the simple idea of a reaper using piles of bodies that they'd reaped as platforms to reach a level exit.

## Day 2
Put in a few hours setting up a repository and some basic build workflow. Did some artwork for the reaper. Got the reaper spritesheet made, loaded, and animated. Messed around a bit with ways of scaling and centering the canvas but was seeing some strange rendering issues so went back to just having a little 320x320 box to work with -- will figure out how to 2x or 3x scale it later. Checked the zipped size of the project - 10k. Obviously will have to do some tuning and compression later on.

## Day 3
Made this readme and pushed up the work I did last night.
